    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Moeca Takeshima. I am 29 years old and from Japan. I moved to the U.S. last December and attended a college in San Diego for the Spring 2024 semester. This is my first semester at ECC, and I am currently working towards a CIS certificate. After earning the certificate, I plan to apply for jobs related to it. I have six years of work experience in Japan, including roles as a police officer, tour guide, and research assistant. I have a husband who works in the IT field, and we plan to start our own IT company with friends in the future.</p>

    <h1>When I have free time, I would like to...</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Go on a road trip with my husband</li>
        <li>Watch Netflix</li>
        <li>Walking around the neighborhood</li>
        </ol>

        <p>My favorite web site is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3School</a> because it offers many free coding courses. </p>
